# Phelte
A PHP framework with Svelte

## Your Application's Glue
Phelte uses a novel approach to handling frontend and backend development. 
It allows for JavaScript and PHP to interface seamlessly by using the 
incredible power of Svelte and the backend capabilities of PHP.

### Constructors and Assemblers
Phelte makes using APIs easy. "Constructors" are our built-in tools to 
help generate APIs. You choose where to listen for requests, who can 
make them and how it'll interact with your backend.

The "assembler" will compile your APIs into the final Svelte build. 
Using the assembler means you don't need to worry about routing, 
URI paths and other application headaches.

### Less boilerplate, less hassle, better code
Behind everything build into Phelte, the aim is to let you write the 
functionality, not the boilerplate. Focused on simplicity, Phelte 
allows you to use your existing programming skills in two of the web's 
most popular languages.
